Schedule Type: Lecture
Grading: This course is graded on the Satisfactory/No Credit scale.

DAEN 527: Learning From Data. 3 credits.
This is an introductory course in machine learning and pattern recognition that covers basic theory, algorithms, and applications. Machine learning is the science of getting computers to act without being explicitly programmed. This course balances theory and practice, and covers the mathematical as well as the heuristic aspects. It provides a broad introduction to machine learning and pattern recognition. Topics include: (i) supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, autoencoders). (iii) Learning theory (bias/variance tradeoffs, VC theory, generalization). (iv) Ensemble methods (boosting and bagging, random forests). (v) Deep learning (deep belief networks, convolutional neural networks, deep autoencoders). The course will draw from numerous case studies and applications.Offered by Engineering & Computing. May not be repeated for credit. Equivalent to ECE 527.
Recommended Prerequisite: (MATH 203 and STAT 346) or equivalent
Registration Restrictions: Enrollment limited to students with a class of Advanced to Candidacy, Graduate, Junior Plus, Non-Degree or Senior Plus.Students in a Non-Degree Undergraduate degree may not enroll.
Schedule Type: Lecture
Grading: This course is graded on the Graduate Regular scale.
