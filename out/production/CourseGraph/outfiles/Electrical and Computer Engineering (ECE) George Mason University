ECE 899: Research Topics in ECE. 3 credits.
Studies advanced research areas in Electrical and Computer Engineering within a course format. Students will develop specialized research skills, which will also involve the presentation of their own work, developed individually and within groups.  This course may be repeated for credit if the research areas differ. Notes: This will be an irregularly scheduled course intended for advanced master's students who want to pursue a specific topic to more depth than a typical course offers at the master's level.  It will prepare students to undertake their individual research topics when they move on to pursue a Ph.D. program, or enter a research environment in their chosen professional careers. Offered by Electrical & Comp. Engineering. May be repeated within the degree for a maximum 9 credits.
