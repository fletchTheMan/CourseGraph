The focus on communities intersects and often
conflicts with the more prominent global peacebuilding frame, often considered an elite endeavor as well as the political economy of the status quo as evidenced in the United States. Why, for example, does the term peacebuilding not appear regularly when considering domestic US conflict and its effects? There are, of course, more questions than answers.
