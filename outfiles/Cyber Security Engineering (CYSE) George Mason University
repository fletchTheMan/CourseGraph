CYSE 682: Formal Methods for Cyber Physical Systems Security. 3 credits.
Formal techniques applied to computer security provide a reliable way of demonstrating that a system is immune to entire classes of attacks (provided the assumptions of the models are satisfied). This is a stark contrast with the more general approach of ruling a system as secure until an attack proves otherwise. This course explores the various ways in which formal methods can be applied to the security of cyber-physical systems. Emphasis is given to CPS used in advanced manufacturing industries and their associated supply chain networks. Topics include formal specification languages for security properties, security analysis utilities, domain-specific security concerns, translating informal requirements to formal specifications in languages such as AADL, satisfiability solvers (SAT), satisfiability modulo theories (SMT), real-time model checking, verification of system requirements, and case studies of formally verified secure systems. Offered by Cyber Security Engineering. May not be repeated for credit.
Registration Restrictions: Enrollment limited to students with a class of Advanced to Candidacy, Graduate, Junior Plus, Non-Degree or Senior Plus.Students in a Non-Degree Undergraduate degree may not enroll.

CYSE 683: Reverse Engineering Industrial Automation. 3 credits.
This course presents fundamental, systems-level concepts for developing an understanding of the underlying functionality of an industrial system without a prior access to the system's design specifications. Considers generalized approaches to developing a set of specifications for a complex system through orderly examination of specimens of that system. Illustrates procedures for identifying the system's components and their interrelationships. Demonstrates methods for creating representations of the system in another form or at a higher level of abstraction. Presents fundamental definitions for forward engineering, reverse engineering, design recovery, restructuring and reengineering. Case studies from several domain areas will be presented to include: integrated circuit (IC) and circuit board analysis, communications protocol analysis, software disassembly, and programmable logic verification. Offered by Cyber Security Engineering. May not be repeated for credit.

CYSE 685: Unmanned Aerial  Systems Security. 3 credits.
This course provides engineers with a background in the essential components and operation of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS), related counter measures and protective measures. It introduces core principles for the safe and secure operation of UAS, especially in the C4I context. Topics are focused on UAS components, characteristics, and operational environment, such as weather and radio propagation.  The course also covers active and passive detection of UAS, methods to avoid detection and for disrupting UAS operations, such as electromagnetic interference and cyberattacks, as well as measures against these methods, such as RADAR and IR stealth concepts. Finally, this course brings a holistic view of UAS security and its future trends. The target audience consists of engineers interested in planning, designing, or participating in UAS operations from a safety and security standpoint. Offered by Cyber Security Engineering. May not be repeated for credit.
