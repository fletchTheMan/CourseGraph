COS 310: Introduction to Science Policy. 3 credits.
This course is an introduction to how science is used to inform governmental policy decisions and how policy impacts U.S. science. The course is intended for any STEM student with an interest in understanding or contributing to decision making at the federal and state level or joining the government to draft policies and legislation directly. Government policies affect all parts of society, including the scientific research enterprise. Reciprocally, science can be used to inform policy in myriad ways at different levels of government. Scientists’ lack of familiarity with policy, and policymakers’ lack of familiarity with science contributes to the longstanding gap between the production of scientific research and its perceived utility by decision-makers. This course will bridge this gap and provide new skills for scientists to contribute to this new field. Offered by College of Science. Limited to three attempts.
