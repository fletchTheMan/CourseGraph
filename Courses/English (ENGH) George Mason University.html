<div class="courseblockdesc">Provides student writers with the skills and mindsets needed to eﬀectively respond to a range of academic and public writing situations with a special focus on the role of language in written communication. Multilingual students—students who are ﬂuent in English and/or students for whom English is an additional language—develop rhetorical reading and writing strategies that attend to the linguistic features and moves enacted in a range of non-ﬁction genres. Students learn to: engage in a process of discovery and consider diverse perspectives before making a judgment, taking a stance, or proposing a solution; locate, evaluate, and synthesize source material to discover and answer complex questions; and reﬂect on their linguistic choices and research and writing processes. Note: Students must attain a minimum grade of C to fulfill degree requirements. Offered by <a target="_blank" href="/colleges-schools/humanities-social-sciences/english/">English</a>.

<div class="courseblockdesc">Provides student writers with the skills and mindsets needed to effectively respond to a range of academic and public writing situations through particular attention to rhetorical flexibility and inquiry-based research. Students learn to engage in a process of discovery and consider diverse perspectives before making a judgment, taking a stance, or proposing a solution. Students learn to analyze and respond to a range of rhetorical situations (writing in various genres for different audiences and purposes); develop strategies to critically read a range of non-fiction genres; engage in in-depth inquiry and writing processes; locate, evaluate, and synthesize source material to discover and answer complex questions; and reflect on what they are learning and how they are applying new knowledge, as well as on their research and writing processes.
